# If this is the first time you connect your Flic, do the following:
# 
# startScan
# press your button and wait for button discovered message
# stopScan
# 
# If you already have connected your Flic, it should show up if you enter:
# 
# list 
# 
# press and hold the button for 8 sec and then enter
# connect __MAC__
# 
# This may take a few tries as my button never glows in public mode. You know it was successfull when is says connected and start track button presses..
